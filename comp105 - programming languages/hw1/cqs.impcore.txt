   a) To me this is okay since factorial can only mean one thing,
      as in it will always mean n*(n-1)*(n-2)....*1
   b) A function named power might mean "multiply x by itself n times"
      but it could very well mean something completly different, the
      name itself isnt fully unambiguous like the factorial function
