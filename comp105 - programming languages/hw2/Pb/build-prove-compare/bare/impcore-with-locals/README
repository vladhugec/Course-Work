COMP 105 - Opsem Assignment - Pair

To solve this problem I decided to create a new parameter to pass into eval(..)
named 'locals,' when locals are declared within a userdefined function, in the
same way the parameter formals was formed, the locals parameter is built from
the namelist and valuelist. I loop through each variable in the namelist and
build a corresponding valuelist setting each value to 0. I pass the construction
to eval(..)
For the VAR and SET sections I needed to add lines creating and binding local
variables in the same was the formals are created and bound.
