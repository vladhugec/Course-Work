I used the template code from the spec for LargeInteger
I talked to one TA but Im ashamed to say I completely forgot his name

Parts of assignment completed:
    I have not completed the LargeNegativeInt nor SmallInt sections
    
How I tested bignum:

    At first I created unit tests at the end of bignum.smt then ran
    usmalltalk -q < bignum.smt
    but then I was recommended by Norman Ramsey to use:
    echo '(use bignum.smt) (use bigtest.smt)' | usmalltalk -q
    I tested sequentially, once I finished NatZero, I moved on to Natnonzero
