/*
 * Code for writing interpreters in C
 * 
 * [*][*] \invisiblelocaltableofcontents[*]
 * 
 * \crefimpcore.chap presents only those parts of the
 * Impcore interpreter that are most relevant to the
 * study of programming languages. If that code is the
 * tip of the iceberg, there's a good deal beneath the
 * surface. Much of it is interesting, some is not.
 * The parts that are generic to writing interpreters,
 * not specific to Impcore, can be found here and in \
 * crefcparse.chap.
 * 
 * This appendix presents most of the implementations of
 * the interfaces shown in \crefimpcore.chap. It also
 * presents interfaces and implementations used to read
 * lines and parenthesized phrases from input.
 * Everything presented here is used not only to help
 * implement Impcore, but also to help implement
 * micro-Scheme and \uschemeplus in \cref
 * scheme.chap,schemes.chap,gc.chap. And almost
 * everything used to implement Impcore is presented
 * here‚Äîwith two exceptions.
 * 
 *   ‚Ä¢ The parsing code used to convert input to
 *  abstract syntax uses a form of shift-reduce
 *  parsing. While the technology is old and is well
 *  understood, when compared to other techniques
 *  I use, it requires elaborate code and complicated
 *  data structures. This complexity is justified
 *  because it makes it easy for you to extend any of
 *  the parsers, but because the code is complex,
 *  it is best presented on its own. The parsing
 *  infrastructure is shown in \crefcparse.chap,
 *  along with its application to the Impcore parser.
 *   ‚Ä¢ There are a few parts of the Impcore interpreter,
 *  like the functions that print abstract syntax, or
 *  the implementation of function environments,
 *  which are not reused in any other interpreter.
 *  These parts are relegated to \crefimpcorea.chap.
 * 
 * All the infrastructure presented here is reusable.
 * If you choose to reuse it to build your own
 * interpreters, your interpreters will be simple and
 * easy to modify, but not fast.
 * 
 * The code in this appendix is organized to parallel
 * the presentation in \crefimpcore.chap. A detailed
 * overview, which connects concepts, types, functions,
 * interfaces, and implementations, is shown in \
 * crefpagecinterps.code-by-concept. A higher-level
 * overview, which shows what information is presented
 * in each chapter or appendix, is shown in \crefpage
 * cinterps.code-by-chapter.

 * Streams
 * 
 * The evaluator works by repeatedly calling [[getxdef]]
 * on a stream of [[XDef]]s. Behind the scenes, there's
 * a lot going on:
 * 
 *   ‚Ä¢ Each [[XDef]] is produced from a parenthesized
 *  phrase, like \monobox(val n 0) or \monobox(define
 *  id (x) x). A parenthesized phrase, which in the
 *  code is called [[Par]], is simply a fragment of
 *  the input in which parentheses are balanced;
 *  converting a parenthesized phrase to an
 *  expression or an extended definition is the job
 *  of the parser presented in \crefcparse.chap.
 *  Producing parenthesized phrases, however, is done
 *  here; function [[parstream]] produces a stream of
 *  [[Par]]s, called [[Parstream]], and [[getpar]]
 *  takes a [[Parstream]] and produces a [[Par]].
 *   ‚Ä¢ A [[Par]] is found on one or more input lines.
 *  (And an input line may contain more than one
 *  [[Par]].) A [[Parstream]] is produced from a
 *  [[Linestream]], and a [[Linestream]] may be
 *  produced either from a string or from an input
 *  file.
 * 
 * Each stream follows the same pattern: there are one
 * or more functions to create streams, and there's a
 * function to get a thing from a stream. Their
 * implementations are also similar. All the streams and
 * their implementations are presented in this section.
 * I present streams of lines first, then parenthesized
 * phrases, and finally extended definitions. That way,
 * as you read each implementation, you'll be familiar
 * with what it depends on.
 * 
 * Streams of lines
 * 
 * A [[Linestream]] encapsulates a seqeuence of input
 * lines.
 * 
 * Interface to Linestream
 * 
 * To use a [[Linestream]], call [[getline_]]. [The
 * function is called [[getline_]] with a trailing
 * underscore so as not to conflict with [[getline]], a
 * POSIX standard function. I~was using [[getline]] for
 * 20~years before the POSIX function was standardized,
 * and I'm too stubborn to change.] The [[getline_]]
 * function prints a prompt, reads the next line of
 * input from the source, and returns a pointer to the
 * line. You needn't worry about how long the line is;
 * [[getline_]] allocates enough memory to hold it.
 * Because [[getline_]] reuses the same memory to hold
 * successive lines, it is an unchecked run-time error
 * to retain a pointer returned by [[getline_]] after a
 * subsequent call to [[getline_]]. A client that needs
 * to save input characters must copy the result of
 * [[getline_]] before calling [[getline_]] again.\
