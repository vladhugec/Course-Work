Please edit this document to include your answers to the questions
below, and use the submit40-lab-strides script to submit your
answers. 

Read these questions before you start doing the lab experiments, and
use these questions to guide your choice of test cases. Remember, the
particular tests listed in the instructions are just  hints for getting
you started: you should run any experiments that you think will help
you answer these questions or understand how the cache works.

Don't worry if you aren't sure you can get all of these questions
right. The goal here is to start teaching you to do what cash
designers do: to think step-by-step through what happens in a cache as
a program runs, he's actual simulations to determine which designs
perform best on which applications, and from them to extract general
principles of cache design.

FOR THESE FIRST FEW QUESTIONS, ASSUME A DIRECT MAPPED CACHE (the
-assoc 1 setting for testcachesim, which is the default).

Cache Size
----------

Q1a: If you know the block size in bytes for a cache and the number of
     lines in the cache, what will be the total size of the cache in
     bytes? 











Q1b: For testcachesim, describe in detail how performance changes as
     the size of the cache gets larger, presuming the size  of the
     test array remains the same?  













Q1c. Is there a point beyond which performance stops improving as
     cache size increases? Why?










Q1d. Sometimes performance is excellent (that is, the cache gives us a
     very good speed up) but then making the test array just a little
     bigger reduces performance dramatically. Why?











Block sizes
-----------

In this section, assume that the total size of the cache we can build
is fixed, but that we get to make choices as to whether to have
fewer lines with bigger blocks, or more lines with smaller.

Q2a  Are bigger blocks always better? Worse? Assuming the total size
     of the cache remains the same, and for an application like
     testcachesim, which block size is best?










Q3.  Would your answer be different for teststride than it was for
     testcachesim?  Why?










Writing data
------------

Q4.  Reread the part of the instructions that explains the
     "Reads_for_writes" count in your cache statistics. Is there a
     value of the block size that will make "Reads_for_writes" zero?
     If you understand this, then you understand a lot about how
     "store-in" caches work.












Q5.  Explain why, for applications that update memory repeatedly, a cache that
     performs better may finish with more dirty blocks than a cache
     that does not perform well on the same application.

                     Associative caches
=================================================================

Q6.  Can you describe a situation in which a fully associative cache
     will outperform a direct-mapped cache?
