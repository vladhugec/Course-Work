This file goes with part 8 of the first lab.  The idea is to give you
some practice thinking about the names of functions.  The problem is a
simple one, so we're going the software equivalent of shooting a fly
with an elephant gun, but because the problem is so simple, it makes
it easy to have a short practice session.

Here is the problem:

  - Suggest three different functions that might be useful in
    implementing `brightness`.

  - For each function, suggest three possible names.

  - For each function, say which name you think is most appropriate
    and *why*.
