 TECHNIQUE

A technique that I have began to implement into my coding is
the use of mapping functions. Mapping functions make it really
easy to work with 1 dimensional and 2 dimensional arrays and
change the data that is presented.  

The way a mapping function works is, it will take in an array,
a void* closure pointer (which is usually NULL), and most
importantly a pointer to another function.  This pointer
is usually called the APPLY function and what it means is that
for every index in an array (for 2D arrays you will need a map_row
and map_col function that says for every index in that row, col)
call the APPLY function on it.  A prototype of a map_row function
will look like this:

void UArray2_map_col_major(UA2 uArray2, MAPFUNC_PTR apply, void *cl)

These functions are extremely useful and make updating data very efficient.
By using mapping functions, it will eliminate the need to write the classic
for loop that looks like this:

    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++){
       // do something
    }
