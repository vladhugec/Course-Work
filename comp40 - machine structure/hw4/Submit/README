Architecture

        40image
                - Checks command line arguments and writes errors if necessary
                - Checks user input to be either -c or -d
                - Calls the appropriate function in compress40.c
        compress40
                - Contains 2 wrapper functions: compress40 and deocmpress40
                - Reads file and calls appropriate function from manipulate.c
                - Writes returned pixmap to a file (stdout in this case)
        manipulate
                - Image manipulation module
                - Contains compress and decompress driver functions
                - Compress driver function
                        - Takes in a pixmap
                        - Converts the RGB pixmap to component video
                                - calls functions from ConvertRGBandCOMP
                        - Calculates quantization data
                                - calls functions from pack_and_unpack
                        - Packs this data into 32 bit words
                                - calls functions from bitpack
                        - Initializes compressed format from specification
                        - Appends these words to standard output
                        - returns nothing (void)
                - Decompress driver function
                        - Takes in FILE * pointer (to stdout in this case)
                        - Initializes decompress file
                                - uses getc() to loop until buffer is at words
                        - Reads each word a character at a time (8 bits)
                        - Unpacks each word
                                - calls functions from bitpack
                        - Converts packed word back to quantization data
                                - calls functions from bitpack
                        - Converts each quantization data to COMPONENT data
                                - calls functions from pack_and_unpack
                        - Converts COMPONENT 2D array to RGB
                                - calls functions from ConvertRGBandCOMP
                        - Returns RGB pixmap
        ConvertRGBandCOMP
                - Has functions that convert RGB maps to COMPONENT video
                - Has functions that convert COMPONENT video to RGB
        pack_and_unpack
                - Has functions that use formulas given in spec
                - Functions to calculate a, b, c, d, Pb, and Pr from y,Pb,Pr
                - Functions to calculate y,Pb,Pr from a, b, c, d, Pb, and Pr
        bitpack
                - functions to generate 32-bit words
                        -  given a word, width, and lsb generate sint or uint
                - functions to get sections of the word
                        - given a width and lsb
                - functions to check whether the word is packable
