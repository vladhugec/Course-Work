\subsection{A}

A polynomial time algorithm $A$ for $COLOR_{1}$ operates as folllows. 
$\newline$

$A = $ "On input $\langle G \rangle $ where $G$ is a graph that can be colored with one color:
$\newline \indent$ 1. Select an arbitrary node $x$ to begin and color it one color.
$\newline \indent$ 2. For each neighbor of $x$, $y_{1}, y_{2}, ... y_{n}$ color them the same color as $x$.
$\newline \indent$ 3. Repeat step 2. for each neighbor of $y_{1}, y_{2}, ..., y_{n}$.
$\newline \indent$ 4. Continue until all nodes in $G$ are colored. "

$\newline$
NOTE: This is just a BFS

\subsection{B}

A polynomial time algorithm $B$ for $COLOR_{2}$ operates as folllows. 
$\newline$

$B = $ "On input $\langle G \rangle $ where $G$ is a graph that can be colored with two colors:
$\newline \indent$ 1. Select an arbitrary node $x$ to begin and color it one color.
$\newline \indent$ 2. For each neighbor of $x$, $y_{1}, y_{2}, ... y_{n}$ color them with the other color.
$\newline \indent$ 3. Repeat step 2. for each neighbor of $y_{1}, y_{2}, ..., y_{n}$, coloring them the $\newline \indent $ opposite color as their predecessors.
$\newline \indent$ 4. Continue until all nodes in $G$ are colored. "
$\newline \indent$ 5. Verify that all for nodes that are connected by an edge, then those $\newline \indent$ vertices are assigned different colors. If test passes then Graph is $\newline \indent$ 2-colorable.

$\newline$ NOTE: As above, just a BFS

\section{}

To show that $COLOR_{k}$ is polynomial time reducible to $COLOR_{k+1}$, assume we have a graph $G$ that is $k$-colored. Now we create a new node of an arbitrary color that is not present in $G$. Now suppose we duplicate $G$ as $G'$ with the caveat that the new node we created will be attached to every other original node in $G$. This way we know that since $G$ is $k$-colored, then $G'$ must be $k+1$-colored. And similarly in reverse, if we know $G'$ is $k+1$-colored, since we node our arbitrarily colored node is not present in $G$ but $G$ is exactly the same otherwise to $G'$, we know $G$ must be $k$-colorable. And so $COLOR_{k} \leq_{P} COLOR_{k+1}$.

Since we know that $COLOR_{1} \in P$, $COLOR_{2} \in P$ and $COLOR_{3}$ is NP-complete. $\forall k \geq 3$ we can reduce $COLOR_{k}$ to $COLOR_{k+1}$ and so we know that $\forall k \geq 3$, $COLOR_{k}$ must be NP-complete.

\subsection{A}

The certificate would be the 3 sets of vertices.

\subsection{B}

To show that $G \in COLOR_{3} \iff G' \in FOREST_{3}$. Assume that $G$ is $3$-colorable. We know that since $G$ is $3$-colorable, a particular node can only be connected to a maximum of $2$ other nodes. Any more than that and the graph is not $3$ colorable. Assume we have a simple graph, $G$, that is $3$-colorable as shown below:

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.2]
\tikzstyle{every node}+=[inner sep=0pt]
\draw [black] (37.9,-4.5) circle (3);
\draw (37.9,-4.5) node {$A$};
\draw [black] (32.2,-14.1) circle (3);
\draw (32.2,-14.1) node {$B$};
\draw [black] (43.9,-14.1) circle (3);
\draw (43.9,-14.1) node {$C$};
\draw [black] (36.37,-7.08) -- (33.73,-11.52);
\fill [black] (33.73,-11.52) -- (34.57,-11.09) -- (33.71,-10.58);
\draw [black] (35.2,-14.1) -- (40.9,-14.1);

\draw [black] (42.31,-11.56) -- (39.49,-7.04);
\fill [black] (39.49,-7.04) -- (39.49,-7.99) -- (40.34,-7.46);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}






Now, adding in $v_{1}, v_{2}, v_{3}$ and connecting it to every other node in the graph including themselves:

\draw (33.9,-20.9) node {$v2$};
\draw [black] (41.7,-20.9) circle (3);
\draw (41.7,-20.9) node {$v3$};

\end{center}

We can see that the set of $3$ subgraphs is $\lbrace A, v_{1} \rbrace$, $\lbrace B, v_{2} \rbrace$, $\lbrace C, v_{3} \rbrace$. Adding in more nodes to $G$, we notice that it is always possible to split the new $G'$ into $3$ subgraphs. If we add node $D$ connected to each $A, B$, the subgraphs would become $\lbrace A, v_{1}, C \rbrace$, $\lbrace B, v_{1}, v_{2} \rbrace$, $\lbrace D \rbrace$. If we add node $E$ connected to each $C, D$, the subgraphs would become $\lbrace A, v_{1}, C \rbrace$, $\lbrace B, v_{1}, v_{2} \rbrace$, $\lbrace D, E \rbrace$. The pattern continues. And so we know that if $G$ is $3$ colorable then $G' \in FOREST_{3}$. Similarly in reverse, since we know $G' \in FOREST_{3}$, we know that $v_{1}, v_{2}, v_{3}$ are the only nodes that violate the connection to a max of two other nodes rule. So if those nodes are removed then it must be possible to $3$-color the resultant graph.
